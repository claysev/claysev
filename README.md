## 👨🏽‍💻 Clayton Severo
I'm a Frontend Developer with expertise on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and experience in implementing SEO strategies for websites. Initially, I studied Pharmacy at UFRJ (Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro) for a while, but I decided to change my career path to the technology field. My knowledge enables me to seek solutions that help companies achieve their goals and stand out in the market. Committed to the quality of my work, I'm always striving for improvement and staying updated on the latest trends in Web Development and SEO.
